# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is a structured approacg to creating software, focusing on planing ,designing and testing software sytems
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software enginering has all the stages of software building while traditional programming  is basically about coding 
software engineering mostly involves teamwork and project management while traditional programming can be more individual
In methods software engineering uses organized methods and practices while traditional progamming may not deploy these methods
we consider teamwork, scope and  methodolog while looking the differences

Softwa Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
1.Proper Planning;Determine the project goals,scope and allocate resources as you work with timelines .
2.Requiremennt analysis;collect and anayle what stakeholders need from the sotfware .
3. Proper design;create the architecture of the software including detailed plans for each component.
4.Implementation ;write the actual code based on the design.
5.Testing ;ensure the software works perfectly by identying and fixing defects including unit,integration,system,and acceptance testing 
6.Deployment;release the software to the users
7.Maintenace; update and improve the software after deployment to fix issues and add new features
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
WATERFALL MODEL
its less flexible 
moves step by step through the SDLC phrases
often used in  project with clear and unchanging requirements
AGILE MODEL
highly flexible
develops software in small ,manageable cycles 
preferred for;projects with changing requirement like web
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the defining ,documenting and managing the needs not forgetting expectations for software .It also ensure the software meets what users need
The process entails ;
Elicitation; collect requirements from stakeholders via interview and survey
Analysis;prioritize and refine requirements to make them clear
specification; documents the requirements formally
Validation;confirm the requirements accurately reflects stakeholders'needs
Management ;continuously monitor and update requirements as the project progresses
There are several importance of this ;
Ensure the final product meets user needs
Helps control project scope and avoid scope creep
Provides a clear plan for designing the software
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity ;this is the breaking the software into smaller,independent parts called modules .Each module has a specific function and can be developed and maintained separately
Maintainability;easier to fix bugs and update feature in individual modules without affecting the whole system 
scalability;This helps to add new features by creating new modules 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
1. UNIT TESTING; test individual  parts of the software to ensure they work correctly alone 
2.INTEGRATION TESTING;This ensures different modules work together properly
3.SYSTEM TESTING; tests the complete software system to ensure it meets requirements
4.ACCEPTANCE TESTING;often checks if the software meets users needs and is ready for release ,mostly involves end-users
Testing is essentials as it helps in 
Finds and fixes defects to ensure functionality 
Ensure the software meets quality standards 
Reduces the risks of failures in production ,protecting against financial and reputational  damage

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control System ; this manages changes to code over time ,aid in teams collaborate  and track changes
this help multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts
keeps a record of changes
enables rollbacks
exampes;git and subversion
git;distributed VCS with branching ,gitlab are build here
subversion;known for simplicity as itS centralized VCS
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
SPM  has different roles
1 .Develops project plans and timelines 
2.Identifies and mitigates potentials risk
3.Manages the project team to ensure task are completed on time 
CHALLENGES;
meeting deadlines while maintaining quality
ensuring optimal use of resources and managing conflict
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintainance entails updating and improving software after  deployment to fix issues and adapt to changes
TYPES OF MAINTENANCE 
Corrective maintenance
Preventive maintenance
Adaptive maintenance
Perfective maintenance
these maintenances corrects the folloings;
makes changes to prevent future issues
enhances functionality based on user feedback
adjust software to work in new surrounding 
fixes  bugs and errors 
IMPORTANCE
cost efficiency
user satisfaction

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?How can software engineers  ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ethics
protecting user data from misuse
avoiding plagiarism
ensuring algorithms are fair
developing secure software to prevent cyber threats
One can adhere to ethical standard by 
1.follow code of conduct
2,Be transparent and honest
3. Staying informed about ethical issues 

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
